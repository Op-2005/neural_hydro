Phase 2: Graph Structure & Bottleneck Characterization - Compact Summary
================================================================================

BASIC METRICS
-------------
Nodes:              10
Edges:               0
Connected Components: 10
Maximum Depth:       0

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN
--------------------
All 10 components are isolated (size = 1 node each):
  01013500, 01022500, 01030500, 01031500, 01047000, 
  01052500, 01054200, 01055000, 01057000, 01073000

PATH STRUCTURE
--------------
Max Path Length:     0 (no edges)
Avg Path Length:      0.0
Root Nodes:           All 10 (each node is both root and leaf)
Leaf Nodes:           All 10

BOTTLENECK ANALYSIS
--------------------
Bottleneck Candidates: None
  - All nodes: in-degree = 0, out-degree = 0
  - No paths exist, so no betweenness

INTERPRETATION
--------------
Graph is fully disconnected:
  • No information flow possible between basins
  • Absolute isolation - each basin independent
  • No structural bottlenecks (no connections to create them)
  • Graph neural networks would provide no benefit over independent models
